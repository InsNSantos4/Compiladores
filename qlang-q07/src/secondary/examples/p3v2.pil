-- Procedural Imperative Language -- loops

n := integer("64");

d := 3;
loop until  d * d > n do writeln d d := d + 1 end;

-- while or until can appear only once, and can be placed anywhere inside the loop:
--    loop A while COND do B end

if d > n then writeln "Number ",n," is prime" else writeln "Number ",n," is not prime" end
